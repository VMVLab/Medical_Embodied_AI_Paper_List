## 🏠 About

Foundation models have demonstrated impressive performance in enhancing  healthcare efficiency. However, their limited ability to perceive and interact  with the physical world significantly constrains their utility in real-world clinical  workflows. Recently, embodied artificial intelligence (AI) provides a promising  physical-interactive paradigm for intelligent healthcare by integrating percep tion, decision-making, and action within a closed-loop system. Nevertheless, the  exploration of embodied AI for healthcare is still in its infancy. To support these  advances, this review systematically surveys the key components of embodied AI,  focusing on the integration of perception, decision-making, and action. Addition ally, we present a comprehensive overview of representative medical applications,  relevant datasets, major challenges in clinical practice, and further discuss the  key directions for future research in this emerging field. The associated project  can be found at XXXX.
