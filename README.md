## 🏠 About

Foundation models have demonstrated impressive performance in enhancing  healthcare efficiency. However, their limited ability to perceive and interact  with the physical world significantly constrains their utility in real-world clinical  workflows. Recently, embodied artificial intelligence (AI) provides a promising  physical-interactive paradigm for intelligent healthcare by integrating percep tion, decision-making, and action within a closed-loop system. Nevertheless, the  exploration of embodied AI for healthcare is still in its infancy. To support these  advances, this review systematically surveys the key components of embodied AI,  focusing on the integration of perception, decision-making, and action. Addition ally, we present a comprehensive overview of representative medical applications,  relevant datasets, major challenges in clinical practice, and further discuss the  key directions for future research in this emerging field. The associated project  can be found at XXXX.

Foundations of embodied AI. a, Publication volume, temporal trends over the past decade,  and representative keywords related to embodied intelligence. The statistics are obtained from Google  Scholar using “embodied AI” as the search query. b, The four developmental stages of embodied intel ligence, namely the Conceptual Germination Stage, Paradigm Shift Stage, Learning-Driven Stage,  and Large Model Empowered Stage. c, A comparison between disembodied intelligence and embodied  intelligence. Unlike its disembodied counterpart, embodied intelligence is distinguished by its inher ent ability to interact with the environment. d, Core components of embodied intelligence. At the  macroscopic level, it consists of agents and their environments; at the technical level, it encompasses  embodied perception, embodied decision-making, and embodied action.

Embodied AI in medicine. Corresponding to the core components of embodied AI, med ical embodied AI encompasses medical embodied perception, medical embodied decision-making,  and medical embodied action. a, Medical embodied perception includes medical instrument and  organ recognition, perception and modeling of surgical and clinical environments, detection of medi cal operational behaviors, and understanding of affective and interactive cues. b, Medical embodied  decision-making encompasses medical workflow modeling and task planning, medical navigation sys tems, and clinical question-answering and decision-support mechanisms. c, Medical embodied action  consists of imitation-based medical actions, reinforcement-based medical actions, and large-model driven medical actions.
